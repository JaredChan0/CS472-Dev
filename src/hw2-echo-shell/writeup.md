After watching this video, please do a short writeup addressing the following prompts:

1. If you had the opportunity to ask Vint one thing what would that be?
2. What is one thing of interest you took away from this video?

1. If I had the opportunity, I would probably have asked Vint Cerf:
With how massively expansive the internet has become in terms of infrastructure, users, and services,
what are your thoughts on Net Neutrality from when it was repealed in 2018 and reinstated in 2024.

2. The one thing that I found the most interesting was how easily scalability became a major issue
that was most often than the not, the reason for many major internet milestones. For example, Arpanet
could only be used via dedicated telephone lines, but the desire for computers to be used in mobile
situations led to a bunch of packet switching technology being developed. This led to an issue where 
these technologies had no easy way to hand off the necessary files over an upscale of computers, which
lead to DNS being created. And this pattern would continue on with the WWW, MOSAIC, and Netscape leading
to an massive influx of users that brought an equally large amount of data being unnecessarily shared for
everyone, which led to the invention of cookies. Since users could now have their own personal/private
computers for use, this then led to so much widespread and unfiltered content that search engines like
Altanet and Google to be created. So on and so on, scalability continues to further escalated and lead
to new milestones, especially now with the surge of social media. So, my takeaway of this video is that
the internet became the way it is now and is still changing because the ever-growing flow of data and
demand forced it to grow so exponentially fast in the 56 years since it had started.
